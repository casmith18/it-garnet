        <p>
          The University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UA Little Rock) is a public
          research university in Little Rock, Arkansas. Established as Little
          Rock Junior College by the Little Rock School District in 1927, the
          institution became a private four-year university under the name
          Little Rock University in 1957. It returned to public status in 1969
          when it merged with the University of Arkansas System under its
          present name. The former campus of Little Rock Junior College is now
          (2019) the campus of Philander Smith University.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 250 acres (100 ha), the UA Little Rock campus encompasses more than
          56 buildings, including the Center for Nanotechnology Integrative
          Sciences, the Emerging Analytics Center, the Sequoyah Research Center,
          and the Ottenheimer Library Additionally, UA Little Rock houses
          special learning facilities that include a learning resource center,
          art galleries, KUAR public radio station,[6] University Television,
          and a campus-wide wireless network. It is classified among "R2:
          Doctoral Universities â€“ High research activity".
        </p>
        <h3>Academics</h3>
        <p>
          The university features more than
          <em>100 undergraduate degrees</em> and 60 graduate degrees, including
          graduate certificates, master's degrees, and doctorates, through both
          traditional and online courses.[13] Students attend classes in one of
          the university's <strong>three</strong> new colleges and a law school.
        </p>
        <h4>Campus living</h4>
        <p>
          UA Little Rock provides a variety of on-campus living options for
          students ranging from traditional resident rooms to multiple-bedroom
          apartments. The university has four residence halls on the eastern
          side of the campus and the University Village Apartment Complex[21] on
          the southern side of campus. Six learning communities focusing on
          criminal justice, arts and culture, majors and careers, future
          business innovators, nursing careers, and STEM are available to
          students.

        <h5>Athletics</h5>
        <p>
          UA Little Rock's 14 athletic teams are known as the Little Rock
          Trojans, with almost all teams participating in the Sun Belt
          Conference. Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not
          sponsor football (UT Arlington being the other); UA Little Rock last
          fielded a football team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock
          Junior College. Little Rock's main athletic offices are located in the
          Jack Stephens Center.
